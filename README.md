# Basic Restaurant Page using JavaScript ES6 to Render
Created restaurant page using ES6 classes and modules.
I am aware of the ongoing argument of whether to use classes or ModulePatters/Factories. 
This project is purely for academic purposes and I have not personally come to a concusion on matter but I do prefer the use of Module Patterns/Factories currently as it is portrays how JavaScript Objects work better than classes do. 
Read [this article](https://medium.com/@rajaraodv/is-class-in-es6-the-new-bad-part-6c4e6fe1ee65) for more info on pros and cons of using Classes in JavaScript.
Another useful resource is [Object Playground](http://www.objectplayground.com/).

## Webpack
This application uses Webpack and so you must make all changes to JS files in src and run webpack using `npm run build`, `npm run dev`, `npm run watch` etc.

The source JavaScript code would be compiled into the `dist` folder's main.js file.

Before doing anything you must first run following command to install all npm packages this project depends upon.
`npm install`
